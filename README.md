## Overview
SnippetTutor is a chrome extension for students of all varieties. Far gone are the days of reading textbooks to find your answers--look no further than your own Google Chrome tab, paired with the power of OpenAI, to answer your homework-related questions with grace and speed!

## Development
This repository is a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) of just 2 projects--an API, and the extension itself.

You can find project-specific readmes in each project folder:
